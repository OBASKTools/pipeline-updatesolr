# OBASK Solr Update Pipeline

Solr update pipeline configures the Solr schema using [solr_schema_initializer.sh](https://github.com/OBASKTools/pipeline-updatesolr/blob/main/solr_schema_initializer.sh). It also index the OBASK Solr with the latest ontology indexes generated by [pipeline-dumps](https://github.com/OBASKTools/pipeline-dumps).

WARNING:_OBASK tools originated with work carried out to support the [Virtual Fly Brain](virtualflybrain.org) project, the [Allen Cell-Type Knowledge Explorer](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/celltypes) and the [Cell Annotation Platform](celltype.info). Work to split this out into OBASK tools is currently ongoing and so code on this repo should be considered Alpha and may be subject to breaking changes._
